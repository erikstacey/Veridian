# Veridian

This project, which I've called Veridian for the sake of giving it a name, is a work-in-progress video game built on top of Simple DirectMedia Layer 2. The game itself is planned to be a building and simulation-type game set in a science fiction setting with sophisticated physics and innovative damage modelling, and my early concepts draw heavy inspiration from games like Factorio, Rimworld, and Oxygen Not Included. At its current stage, I'm developing the core functionality which is typically handled by a commercial game engine (e.g. game object management, rendering).

# Motivations

I've developed some very basic games with commercial game engines (Unity, Godot, Unreal) to explore my interest in game development. I found that, while these were very extensive in terms of software features, I was more interested in utilizing my programming skills to develop my own lightweight, tailored solution and maybe learn a few things in the process. Therefore, I've opted to use SDL2 as the basis for my game on the basis that it handles liasing with platform-specific rendering APIs and input/output while placing very little to no restriction on the structure of the rest of the program.

# Future of This Project

Ultimately, this is something I periodically work on in my spare time (along with many other projects) and is ultimately a work of personal interest. I've been working on it for approximately 2 years and have gone through a few structural iterations. In the past, my objective has been to write a game _engine_ then build a game on top of it. I've decided that, in in the interest of moving this project along it's better to build the game directly. I plan to keep this repository updated with the core game code as it is developed, however once I reach the stage of the high-level game design I will cease updating this repository.
