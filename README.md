# Veridian

This project is currently the foundations of a 2D video game built upon the SDL2 library. I'm currently developing [GECS](https://github.com/erikstacey/gecs) to provide a highly optimized memory management system, and as such development on this project is currently on hold pending sufficient progress on GECS that the two can be developed concurrently.
